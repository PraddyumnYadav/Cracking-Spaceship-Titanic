    "# **Cracking SpaceShip Titanic**\n",
    "- Welcome to the year *2912*, where your data science skills are needed to solve a **cosmic mystery**. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.\n",
    "- The **Spaceship Titanic** was an `interstellar` passenger `liner` launched a month ago. With almost `13,000` passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage *transporting emigrants* from our solar system to three newly habitable **exoplanets** orbiting nearby stars.\n",
    "- While rounding `Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary` Spaceship Titanic collided with a **spacetime anomaly** hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!\n",

    "- To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.\n",
